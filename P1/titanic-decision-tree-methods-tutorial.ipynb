Each decision leads to one of two possibilities. Each decision leads to another decision or it leads to prediction.\nAny block diagram of a trained tree shows a number of boxes, which are called `nodes`. There are two types of nodes: Nodes can either pose a yes/no question of the data, or they can be terminal nodes that assign a prediction to examples that end up in them. Terminal nodes are often referred to as `leaf` nodes. \n\nWhen an observation or row is passed to a nonterminal node, the row answers the node’s question. If it answers yes, the row of attributes is passed to the leaf node below and to the left of the current node. If the row answers no, the row of attributes is passed to the leaf node below and to the right of the current node.  The process continues recursively until the row arrives at a terminal (that is, leaf) node where a prediction value is assigned to the row. The value assigned by the leaf node is the mean of the outcomes of the all the training observations that wound up in the leaf node."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8d9bf8b75fff9693718c0becd2d55b8072e08c25"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How to Train a Binary Decision Tree\nLets look at a simple example.
